title: about bloom.sys
---
hi! we're bloom.sys, generally known in more formal cases as maple bloom. we're a 25 year old transgender something or other that does a lot of things, primarily residing in Exeter, United Kingdom.

our primary project and current claim to fame is Fragment, a stickerbombing and graffiti alias spreading rouge thoughts, unfinished stories and weird looking rabbits wherever a light pole or electrical box dares to exist. 
## bloom.sys members
we consider ourselves to be a median plural system. we don't have great control over who's fronting at any given time, and we all share memories and interests (although some have greater influence with them than others). our members are:
- Maple (she/it) - the main fronter and the core of the system. a robot rabbit that seems to have cat traits coded into her, for some reason. enjoys drawing and graphic design, hardcore music, exploring urban areas, and being petted and fussed on. anxious and emotionally volatile at times, but trying it's best no matter what!
- Sunday (she/they) - considered to be the protector of the system. a ghost training to be a witch through chaos magic. enjoys journaling and studying, incense and candles, and piano melodies. comparative to Maple, often very emotionally stunted and cold, which often results in her taking the front when Maple becomes too overwhelmed. 
- Mayday (she/they) - formally thought of to be a blend of Maple and Sunday, but now considered to be her own being. the workhouse of the system, able to generate energy and focus at an alarming rate, and get shit done when it needs doing. she's still not entirely sure on her personality - similar to Maple's, but different...?
- rosie (mew/mews) - the little of the system. an extremely skittish and nervous child, holding a lot of trauma from our early years, but trying to reach out and make more friends. enjoys old cartoons, lego building, and soft plushies. while we don't consider mew a fictive, mew's form often takes that of the main character from the titular A Rabbit with Checkered Ears. 
## bloom.sys interests
- stickers. making stickers, collecting stickers, comparing tools used for stickers, and studying the medium. 
- graphic design, ui layouts, logos, anything that can be taken to with a hammer and used to make new graphical mashups. 
- rhythm games. while we've been playing them less as the years go on, we still enjoy keeping up with updates to games and the music artists in the scene. currently, the rhythm game we've been playing the most is EZ2ON REBOOT:R, though Cytus 2, Arcaea and Phigros all used to be pretty big fixations.
- old television media, including both tv shows, adverts / continuity, and channel branding. this has been a major fixation throughout our whole lives, and i don't even remember how it started, but now i can tell you about the branding history of all the major UK television channels and i'm not sure what to do with that.
- as an extension of this, Public Service Announcements / Information Films and related media. this we *can* explain, in that it's fascinating to examine the tactics used to inform or misinform people of the dangers of drugs, fires, domestic abuse, littering... uh, falling into water...   ...blood donation... 
- video games - this one's pretty broad, but with video games we tend to fall in an out through obsessively playing a game for weeks and then stopping for 6 months. current favourite games to play include Picross, Balatro, and Lumines. 
## bloom.sys pride
- we're autistic, and have been diagnosed since a very young age. we hyperfixate and ramble about interests a lot, do a bunch of physical and vocal stims, struggle with reading people, and can have problems or be fatigued around social situations, busy or quiet. 
- we're transgender, generally leaning on a feminine and transhumanism side of things. i had passed myself around as non-binary for a while in my teens before realizing a lot of what i really wanted all along was just to be a girl. a short while after that Maple realised that being software that's coded into a robot was also really affirming. we started HRT around november 2022. 
- we're pansexual and panromantic. gender doesn't really play a role into why we're attracted to people. 
- we're polyamorous, and currently dating two partners, Sette and Mark. this body in general contains a lot of love and appreciation for people, and we're generally fans of the idea of being able to love your friends without the need to get into any kind of "formal relationship" about it.
