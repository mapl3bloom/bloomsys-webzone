well, this should be funny. 

a bit of pre-amble backstory - the reason i have this book is because my dad got it in a duplicate lootcrate, didn't want it, and so gave it to me. this was long before the movie came out and it started being blasted everywhere on social media. i remember somewhat liking it as a kid, and trying to do a re-read later on in life and not quite being able to get through it. but why did i keep this book... probably just because it's really funny to own given how the movie and sequel have panned out. regardless, i think it's going to be a great story to pick apart, especially since large parts of it are basically just analyzing one character who died long before this book started, featuring sections from his "almanac" that the characters use as some sort of fuckin' bible.

what follows are a collection of notes made as i have been reading the book.

they way the main character already talks about how obsessed his generation becomes with halliday and this hunt... it's... giving me weird vibes of the people who continuously stalk and praise elon musk and jeff bezos but taken to the nth degree. i can't really believe that EVERY SINGLE PERSON in his generation starts obsessing over this puzzle. surely there are activists still trying to change the real world, fighting politicians? i guess i'm mostly just going from what ive seen of the latest and greatest gens (z and alpha) but everyone deciding to bury themselves into a bubble of escapism seems... unrealistic.

"this led to a global fascination with 1980s pop culture" okay, to be fair - 1980s pop culture has continued to be all the rage for a while now, people keep remaking songs and franchises and tons of different things from that era...

mmm, sleeping on piles of clothes in a laundry room, sounds like a comfy thursday night...

"the processor was slower than a sloth by current standards" the idea of a processor being that slow in 2035 is astounding to me. same with "it was a bulky, heavy beast". the whole trend with laptops is that they're getting thinner and smaller...? i feel like the author wants us to imagine some sort of 2003-ish era laptop, but we're in 2045. i can't imagine this not looking at least like a slightly futuristic artpiece. 
also - i really, really, really hate to be that person - but instead of using it's "stone-age operating system" you could put linux onto it,

breaking news - 11 year old kid finds out world isn't nice, becomes emo immediately

i think what you have to remember about human beings is that they're not just lying to you, they're lying to themselves too, and passing it on because it's what they genuinely believe

"coding my first atari 2600 game, a rite of passage for a gunter" i feel like at the very least you could pick a better console to try and produce a game on. like the intellivision. who thinks about the intellivision nowadays

i'd like to imagine at some point in the 2020s james halliday got *really* into crypto, realized it was a sham, and then just invented his own currency anyway

given the power of the OASIS i have to wonder what sort of stances they have with the governments, and if that would even mean anything in regards to someone being able to take them over. this easter egg hunt feels sorta like "find my treasure and you will literally become king of the world with the most uptold influence responsible". that's... sorta terrifying? i wonder how many gunters realize what sort of power winning this contest would actually hold, especially if a large evil corporation is trying to win it too. i wonder how many of them would have the power go to their feeble heads. i wonder how many of them would do so, so much worse than IOI. it could be argued that clans of gunters would essentially be like a parliament winning the contest, if the parliament were a bunch of toxic online 16 year olds

...my only major note on this chapter was that ernest cline writes in a jackass using the f-slur in a derogatory way. i get that it's representative of toxic online culture, but i'm still shocked that ernest and his proofreaders was like "yeah, that's good, print it"

no way so many companies would collaborate like this in one virtual world. if this was truly set in the modern day they'd all be trying to make their own OASIS-like platforms to advertise their own creations. even Fortnite doesnt let everything co-exist at once, special events and costumes are timed affairs

okay FIRST OF ALL does literally EVERYTHING in this world have to be a reference?? second of all, there's DOUBLE the amount of cubes in a rubiks cube than sectors in this map, so half of this cube is missing, and THIRD OF ALL, THE FUCKING PERSPECTIVE OF THESE SECTORS MEANS A LOT OF THEM AREN'T EVEN GOING TO BE CUBES
also "i knew this was no coincidence" a rubiks cube is the most BASIC FUCKING 80S THING YOU COULD REFERENCE EVER HALLIDAY ISNT FUCKING HIDING A RUBIKS CUBE FOR PEOPLE TO FIND IN HIS SIMULATION OH MY GOD

this seems just as hellish to be in as the real world, except worse, because you're being tantalised with all sorts of wild things across everything in the virtual world that you can just never access because you're poor. a nicer world than the one you live in exists, but you can't touch it
it's wild how anyone can believe this virtual world is a utopia when it so very clearly replicates the exact same class struggles as the real world just simply due to the fact that it decided to have an economy that replicated the real world for some reason. its virtual data. the only reason you could need money for things like fuel and transportation is greed

having your friend be your business partner seems like the worst idea possible

"despite his eccentricies, no one ever questioned halliday's genius" i call bullshit on that if only because of the amount of people right now questioning every hit maker or billionaire autism dude for their actions and functions, how they flaunt themselves, become self absorbed under their own hype, and especially in halliday's case cause chaos internally within the company. genuinely, gregarious games should have gotten rid of his ass

the ongoing energy crisis probably ended up being contributed to by the OASIS by making everyone stay on their computers 0.0

the problem with making a book about the pop culture of your time is that capitalism and the endless cycle of continuing franchises to make money makes referring to stories as set and done always, ALWAYS fails
the obsession with the 80s is so.... so, fucking horrid. nobody wants to make anything in the future when everything is gone, so of course they'll all just get stuck in the past
what original franchises even *exist* in the 2050s?

the consumption of art simply to turn it into a bunch of quick fire references and jokes feels... horrifying to me. there's nothing wrong with some here or there but when that's ALL you can do, when that's ALL you know how to communicate, you are not living for yourself nor do you care to have your own identity anymore. you have become a walking machine living within hell

its no surprise everyone in this book is just a walking, talking box of references if this is how they've grown up watching entertainment and listening to music. never out of any enjoyment for themselves, solely out of the obsession with one guy they never knew

i do think it's a bit wild that the entirety of public school takes place on one planet. shouldn't there be other competiting public schools? or is this simply not viable in a capitalistic hellworld? probably the latter...
