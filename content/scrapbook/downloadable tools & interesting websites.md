this page mostly contains a bunch of independent tools i like using, and websites i like browsing from time to time and downloading things from. 

## downloadable tools
[Button Stealer](https://anatolyzenkov.com/stolen-buttons/button-stealer) - A Chromium extension that grabs and catalogues buttons from websites you visit.
[Fontbase](https://fontba.se) - Been using this as of recent to try and organize the mess of fonts I've downloaded over the many years.
[Instant Eyedropper](http://instant-eyedropper.com) - System tray tool that lets you drag over any pixel to find out it's colour hex code.
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - Notetaker / diary platform of choice, and what this website is written on. 
[ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com) - Lets you capture any part of your computer screen and turn it into a .gif file.
[SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) - A free to download (sans iOS and Android platforms) tracker that also uses modular synthesis. Runs on some very interesting devices, including some old Windows CE PDAs, and Palm OS PDAs.
[Quantum VJ](https://warmplace.ru/soft/qvjhd/) - Audio visualization tool that can make some pretty fun visual effects.
## interesting websites
[blinkies.cafe](https://blinkies.cafe) - An image generator for making some of your own badge GIFs.
[Insecam](http://www.insecam.org)- A directory of unsecured webcams online. I like using these for background visuals when working. 
[The 88x31 GIF Collection](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/)- Immensely huge archive of 88x31 buttons made over the internet's life. Warning for lots of flashing images.
